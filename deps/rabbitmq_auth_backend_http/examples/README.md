# RabbitMQ HTTP Authn/Authz Backend Examples

## Python Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_django` is a very minimalistic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 1.10+ application
that rabbitmq-auth-backend-http can authenticate against. It's really
not designed to be anything other than an example.

### Running the Example

Run `start.sh` to launch it after [installing Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/install/). You may need to
hack `start.sh` if you are not running Debian or Ubuntu.

The app will use a local SQLite database. It uses the standard
Django authentication database. All users get access to all vhosts and
resources.

### HTTP Endpoint Examples

If you're not familiar with Django, urls.py and auth/views.py may be
most illuminating.


## Spring Boot Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_spring_boot` is a simple [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
application that rabbitmq-auth-backend-http can authenticate against. It's really
not designed to be anything other than an example.

## Running the Example

Import the example as a Maven project in your favorite IDE or run it directly from the command line:

    mvn spring-boot:run
    
The application listens on the 8080 port.

### HTTP Endpoint Examples

Have a look at the `AuthBackendHttpController`. There's only one user: `guest`,
with the `guest` password. This implementation also checks the
routing key starts with an `a` when publishing to a topic exchange 
or consuming from a topic. (an example of [topic authorisation](http://next.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html#topic-authorisation)).
