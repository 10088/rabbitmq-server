rabbitmq_auth_backend_django is a very very simple Django application
that rabbitmq-auth-backend-http can authenticate against. It's really
not designed to be anything other than an example.

Run start.sh to launch it after installing Django somehow (e.g. sudo
apt-get install python-django). You may need to hack start.sh if you
are not running Debian / Ubuntu.

The app will create a SQLite database in /tmp/. It uses the standard
Django authentication database. All users get access to all vhosts and
resources.

If you're not familiar with Django, urls.py and auth/views.py may be
most illuminating.
